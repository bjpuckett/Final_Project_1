You surprisingly find yourself at the end of the forest in a beautiful valley. You scan the area and you find what alarmed you.\nYou spot two people engaged in mortal combat. One person is a human, who looks to be dressed in some type of clerical robes bleeding on the ground crawling potentially on the verge of death.\nThe human is crying to you to save him.

The lizard is a very capable fighter. It wields the heavy axe as if it were a mere dagger. The lizard's heavy blows are backing you down. He hits you with an overhead strike which you block but the sheer force brings you to take a knee. The lizard raises his axe in preparation to deliver the final blow. As the axe begins its descent you pull out a small dagger and stab the lizard through the food causing the axe to alter its course.\nThe axe hits the ground, and the lizard lets out a loud cry. You stand up and stab the lizard killing it. You cast heal on yourself and the priestly-looking figure.",)

Peering into the inquisitor's mind you confirm all that the lizard said was true and more. Such horrific atrocities the inquisitor committed in the name of the Vatican and Beezlebub. You nod to the lizard and with a giant swing of his axe, splits the inquisitor in half.")
